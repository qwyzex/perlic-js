# Perlic JS
## Personal-Public JavaScript Projects
Not an actual projects, just a bunch of JavaScript code that I store on GitHub. Mostly just for fun and backup my *"experience"* so that I could always refer here if I messed up or forgot something.
## Not A Professional
Please note that I am not a Professional JavaScript Developer, so if you find that my code is cringe, stupid and bad, don't bully me :3
